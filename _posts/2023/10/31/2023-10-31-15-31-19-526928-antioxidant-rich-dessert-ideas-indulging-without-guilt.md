Incorporating antioxidant-rich ingredients into your desserts not only satisfies your sweet tooth but also provides a host of health benefits. Here are some delicious ideas for antioxidant-rich desserts that will allow you to indulge without guilt.

Chia seeds are packed with antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and fiber. Combine chia seeds, your choice of plant-based milk (such as almond milk or coconut milk), and a sweetener of your choice (such as honey or maple syrup). Stir well and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight to allow the chia seeds to absorb the liquid and form a pudding-like texture. Top it with fresh fruits and nuts for added flavor and crunch. This creamy and nutritious chia seed pudding makes for a delightful antioxidant-rich dessert.
