The centerpiece of any Thanksgiving feast is the turkey. Thankfully, a gluten-free turkey is easy to achieve by using simple ingredients and proper preparation. Start by selecting a turkey that is explicitly labeled as gluten-free. Some turkey brands may inject gluten-containing ingredients into their products.

Season your turkey with a blend of herbs, butter, and garlic. Make sure to stuff the turkey with gluten-free stuffing or aromatic herbs and vegetables to enhance its flavor. Roast the turkey at the appropriate temperature and baste it periodically to keep it moist and flavorful. Your gluten-free roast turkey will be the star of the show!

These alternatives can still provide that perfect balance of flavors and textures that stuffing is known for.

Saut√© onions, celery, and your favorite herbs in butter or oil. Add the gluten-free bread cubes or crumbles and vegetable broth to moisten it. Bake until the top is crispy and golden brown. This savory gluten-free stuffing will complement your turkey perfectly and leave everyone wanting more.
