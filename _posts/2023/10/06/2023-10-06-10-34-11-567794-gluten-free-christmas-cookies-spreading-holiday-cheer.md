## Why Gluten-Free Cookies?

Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, is responsible for the elastic texture in baked goods. However, for people with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to unpleasant symptoms such as digestive issues and fatigue. Hence, it becomes crucial to find alternatives that allow them to enjoy the holiday season without compromising their health.

Gluten-free Christmas cookies are a perfect way to ensure that everyone can partake in the holiday spirit. By using gluten-free flours like almond flour, rice flour, or gluten-free baking mixes, you can create tasty and satisfying cookies that are just as delightful as their gluten-filled counterparts.
