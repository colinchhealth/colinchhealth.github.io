However, with a few simple substitutions and a tasty gluten-free coating, you can enjoy crispy and flavorful fried chicken right in the comfort of your own home. In this article, we will share a gluten-free fried chicken recipe that guarantees a satisfying crunch without compromising on taste.

## Ingredients:

- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (such as thighs or drumsticks)
- 1 cup gluten-free flour blend (make sure it contains xanthan gum for a better texture)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for added heat)
- 2 eggs
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions:

1. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well until all the spices are evenly incorporated.

5. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or deep fryer to 350째F (175째C). The oil should be deep enough to fully submerge the chicken pieces.

6. Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, skin side down. Be cautious to not overcrowd the pan or fryer as it may result in uneven cooking.

7. Fry the chicken for about 8-10 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. To ensure the chicken is fully cooked, you can use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature, which should reach 165째F (74째C).

8. Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.

9. Serve the gluten-free fried chicken hot, alongside your favorite dipping sauces or sides.
