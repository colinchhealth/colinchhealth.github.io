## Introduction
At the start of every new year, many of us set resolutions in an effort to improve ourselves and our lives. One common resolution is to adopt healthier eating habits and break free from emotional eating patterns. However, it's important to approach this goal in a realistic and attainable way to increase the chances of long-term success. In this blog post, we will explore the connection between emotional eating and New Year resolutions, and discuss strategies for setting attainable goals.

## Understanding Emotional Eating
Emotional eating refers to the act of turning to food for comfort or as a coping mechanism for dealing with emotions. It often involves consuming large amounts of food, especially unhealthy options, in response to stress, sadness, boredom, or other emotional triggers. Emotional eating can be a significant barrier to achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, making it an important issue to address when setting New Year resolutions.

## The Pitfall of Unrealistic Goals
One common mistake people make when setting resolutions related to emotional eating is setting unrealistic goals. For example, deciding to completely eliminate all comfort foods or vowing to never indulge in a craving again. While these goals may seem admirable and well-intentioned, they can often lead to feelings of failure and disappointment when they prove to be unattainable.

## Setting Attainable Goals for Success
The key to successfully overcoming emotional eating lies in setting realistic and attainable goals. Here are a few strategies to consider:

### 1. Start Small
Instead of completely eliminating comfort foods, start by reducing the frequency or portion sizes. Gradually decrease your reliance on food for emotional comfort, giving yourself time to adjust to new habits and find alternative coping mechanisms.

### 2. Identify Emotional Triggers
Take the time to identify the specific emotions or situations that trigger your emotional eating. This can help you develop strategies to address these triggers in healthier ways, such as engaging in stress-reducing activities, practicing mindfulness, or seeking support from friends and family.

### 3. Seek Professional Help if Needed
If emotional eating is a persistent issue in your life, consider seeking help from a registered dietitian, therapist, or counselor who specializes in emotional eating. They can provide valuable guidance, support, and strategies tailored to your individual needs.

### 4. Celebrate Progress, Not Perfection
Remember that overcoming emotional eating is a journey, and it's important to celebrate progress along the way. Instead of focusing on perfection or slip-ups, acknowledge and celebrate each step forward you take. This positive reinforcement will help to motivate and sustain your progress.

### 5. Build a Support System
Surround yourself with a supportive network of friends, family, or even an online community who understand and empathize with your struggles. Share your goals, seek encouragement, and lean on this support system during challenging times.

## Conclusion
Setting attainable goals is essential for successfully breaking free from emotional eating patterns and adopting healthier habits. By starting small, identifying emotional triggers, seeking professional help if needed, celebrating progress, and building a support system, you can increase your chances of making sustainable changes and achieving your resolutions. Remember, be kind to yourself, as change takes time and effort, but with determination and the right approach, you can overcome emotional eating and achieve a healthier relationship with food.
