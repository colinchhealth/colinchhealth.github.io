### Why hydration is important
Before we delve into the benefits of herbal infused waters, let's quickly remind ourselves why staying hydrated is crucial for our overall well-being. Proper hydration is essential for numerous bodily functions, including maintaining body temperature, lubricating joints, aiding digestion, and delivering nutrients throughout the body. It also helps to flush out toxins and supports healthy skin. Dehydration, on the other hand, can lead to fatigue, dizziness, headaches, and impaired cognitive function.

### What are herbal infused waters?
Herbal infused waters are simply water that has been flavored with a combination of fruits, herbs, and sometimes vegetables. They provide a refreshing and natural alternative to sugary drinks, while still adding flavor and depth to your hydration routine. The natural ingredients infuse their flavors into the water, creating a subtly fragrant and delicious drink.

### The benefits of herbal infused waters
1. **Increased water intake**: Adding a burst of flavor to your water can encourage you to drink more. Herbal infused waters can make staying hydrated a more enjoyable experience, helping you meet your daily intake goals.
2. **Antioxidant boost**: Many herbs and fruits used in herbal infused waters are rich in antioxidants, which help to neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. Antioxidants play a crucial role in protecting cells from damage and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.
3. **Unique health benefits**: Different herbs and fruits offer their own unique health benefits. For example, mint leaves can aid digestion, cucumber slices can hydrate and refresh the skin, and lemon slices can provide a dose of vitamin C. By infusing water with various ingredients, you can enjoy a variety of health-promoting properties.
4. **Calorie-free and sugar-free**: Herbal infused waters are naturally calorie and sugar-free, making them a healthier choice compared to sugary drinks or artificially sweetened beverages.
5. **Variety and creativity**: One of the best things about herbal infused waters is the endless combination of flavors you can experiment with. From citrus fruits to berries, herbs to spices, you can create your own unique blends to suit your taste preferences.

### How to make herbal infused waters
Making herbal infused waters is incredibly simple and customizable. Here's a basic recipe to get you started:
